This page documents hands-on projects I'm building as I develop foundational skills in platform engineering. 
These projects focus on learning, experimentation, and applying concepts through real configurations rather than production systems.

## Linux Lab Environment 

**Goal:** Build a local Linux environment to practice system administration and troubleshooting. 

**What I did:**
- Installed and configured Linux in a lab environment
- Practiced basic system administration tasks
- Explored user management, permissions, and services

**What I learned:**
- Navigating Linux systems confidently
- Understanding how services and processes interact
- Troubleshooting issues using logs and system tools

**Status:** In progress

**Next Steps:**
