## Week 2 Progress Update

Week 2 was focused on building conistency and getting more comfortable working directly in Linux and GitHub. Rather than trying to move too fast my goal this week was to strengthen fundamentals and start forming better habits around documentation and experimentation.

## What I Focused On

### Installing Ubuntu on Lenovo T440
This week, I installed Ubuntu on a Lenovo T440 laptop to create a dedicated Linux lab environment. The goal was to move beyond virtualized environments and work directly with Linux on bare hardware. 

The installation process requred troubleshooting several BIOS-related challenges, including:
- Switching between UEFI and Legacy boot modes
- Correctly configuring boot priority for USB devices
- Understanding how Secure Boot and legacy settings affect Linux installs

Working through these issues helped me better understand how firmware, bootloaders, and operating system installation interact at a lower level.

### Linux Fundamentals (Hands-On)
After completing the installation, I spent time working directly in the Linux terminal to become morecomfortable navigating and administering the system. 

Areas of focus included:
- Navigating the filesystem using commands
- Managing users, permissions, and basic services
- Reading logs and understanding how system processes interact

The biggest improvement this week was feeling less "lost" in the terminal and more intentional with commands.

## Challenges This Week

The biggest challenge this week was troubleshooting the Ubuntu installation on older hardware.

Dealing with BIOS settings, boot modes, and USB detection required patience and methodical testing. While frustrating at times, it reinforced the importance of understanding system behavior rather than relying on step-by-step guides alone.

This experience highlighted how real-world systems often require investigation, experimentation, and presistence-skills that translate directly to infrastructure and platform engineering work.

## What I Learned

- Comfort in Linux comes from repetition, not memorization
- Git makes more sense when used consistently on a real project
- Clear documentation is a skill, not an afterthought
- Linux installation issues often stem from firmware and boot configuration, not the OS itself
- Troubleshooting requires isolating variables and testing one change at a time
- Hands-on setup builds confidence faster than tutorials alone

## Looking Ahead to Week 3

Next week, I plan to:
- Coninue strengthening Linux fundamentals
- Begin automating small tasks using shell scripts
- Start exporing container concepts at a high level

The focus will remain on learning by doing and documenting progress along the way.
