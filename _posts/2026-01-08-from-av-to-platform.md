tags: [linux, fundamentals, career-transition]
---



## Background
I am currently an AV Engineer in a manufacturing environment and I am transitioning into Platform Engineering with a focus on cloud infrastructure, automation, and reliability. 



## Why I'm Making the Change
I have spent years designing, deploying, maintaining, and troubleshooting complex AV systems in production environments. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and breaking down complex systems into manageable components. I want to apply this systems-focused approach to cloud platforms, automation, and modern infrastructure engineering. 



## What I Studied This Week
- Linux fundamentals
- Basic command line navigation
- Git and GitHub basics



## What I Built
- Created GitHub account and Pages site
- Linux lab setup (in progress)
- Initial documentation structure



## Challenges 
Learning Git and GitHub workflows was the biggest adjustment. Documenting as I go is helping reinforce the fundamentals. 



## Looking Ahead to Week 2
- Install Ubuntu on Lenovo T440
- Start Docker basics
- Continue Linux practice
