## About Me

I'm an AV Engineer working in a manufacturing environment, currently exploring a transition into **Platform Engineering**. My interest in the field comes from years of supporting advanced AV systems, troubleshooting complex issues, and working with technology that must be reliable in real-world environments. 

Throughout my career in AV, I've designed, programmed, deployed, and maintained systems that support business operations. That experience has strengthened my ability to think in terms of **systems**, identify rot causes under pressure, and continuously improve how technology is deployed and supported. 

## Why Platform Engineering

While I have not yet worked as a platform engineer, the **concept of platform engineering strongly aligns with parts of my work I've consistently enjoyed**-automation, reliability and reducing operational friction. 

I'm naturally curious about how modern infrastructure is built and maintained, and i'm interested in how platforms and enable teams to move faster while maintaining stability. Rather than assuming this path is the right fit, I'm actively validating that interestby building hands-on experience and documenting what I learn. 

## What I'm Learning and Exploring
- Linux fundamentals and system administration
- Git and GitHub workflows
- Containers and Docker Fundamentals
- Kubernetes and cloud-native concepts
- CI/CD and infrastructure automation

## Purpose of This Site

This site serves as a public learning journal where I document:
- What I'm studying
- What I'm building
- Challenges I encounter and how I work through them

My golas is to develop a strong foundation in platform engineering while creating a transparent record of my growth and technical curiosity.
